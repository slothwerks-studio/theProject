# theProject
## What is the Project?
The project is an open source community-driven full-stack application.  Ultimately, the core development team will dictate the project's scope; however, the initial concept is thus:

* A public repo, freely accessible to the public.
* No definitive timeline for completion.
* Two-week sprints, with goals dictated by what each team member can __reasonably__ accomplish during that timeframe.
* *Robust documentation:*  on-boarding new team members merely consists of reading existing material.
* *Intentional design:*  the project will be extremely well-defined prior to implementation of code.

## Why are we doing this?
One of the major struggles for new and aspiring developers is to build a portfolio that can be shown to prospective employers.  In addition, these portfolio pieces are more often than not created on one's own time.  Carving out that time can be extremely difficult, and keeping up the momentum for a long-term project can be exhausting.  With this project we will sustain the momentum through a diverse core group of technologists who are interested in one or more of the following:

* Meeting and working with fellow technologists
* Learning new technologies
* Deepening one's existing knowledgeset
* Sharing knowledge with others
* Acquiring "saleable" development and design skills
* Attaining proficiency with git and version control
* Learning and implementing agile development practices
* Going "full stack"
* Gauging project cost and time estimation
* Creating a worthwhile, useful, well-oiled final product
